    <h3> A Turtle's Heart</h3>
    <p><b>by MILI</b></p>

<p>Monday is a rainy day<br>
And I stay inside, letting time pass away<br>
Tuesday it is quite the same<br>
So I daydream about moments of shame<br>
<br>
Life goes around and 'round<br>
I've stumbled and stopped moving on<br>
Turn around and I realized<br>
That I have been left behind<br>
<br>
In a tiny tiny, tiny, tiny cubicle<br>
There lives a whiny, whiny, whiny cowardly turtle<br>
In 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years<br>
My heart won't die, no matter how hard I try<br>
<br>
Today is a lonely day<br>
I pretend that I really liked it this way<br>
Tomorrow will stay the same<br>
And I can't even remember your name<br>
<br>
You're around no more, no more<br>
Though this love of mine<br>
It just won't stop<br>
<br>
Nobody—body—body—body to support<br>
My heavy, heavy, heavy but empty shell<br>
But I'm not lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy anymore<br>
Oh darling can't you see<br>
I've grown so much more<br>

Maybe, maybe, maybe you've forgiven me<br>
Oh but darling, darling, darling you have to make sure<br>
To stab me, pierce me, hurt me, kill me thoroughly<br>
You see my heart won't die though I really tried</p>
